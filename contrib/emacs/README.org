#+TITLE: magit-fastcommit

So one day I thought it's high time to start using ~org-mode~, but
wasn't happy with any of the solutions to keep my files in sync between
different machines I could find.

After some time of struggling a striking question crossed my mind:
/Why not just use git?/
But there was one problem with that - commit messages, especially combined
with my some-kind-of-version-control-OCD - inventing one each time I want to make a change
would basically be duplicating the effort I put into writing these files,
and putting strings like /changes/ or /aaa/ was simply a big no-no.

This simple package tries to provide a remedy for my (and, hopefully, yours too!)
OCD by adding a *commit with an auto-generated message* action to ~magit~'s commit popup.
Currently such auto-generated message simply means *UUIDv4*, but more human-friendly
options are underway.
